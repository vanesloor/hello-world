# hello-world
First repository

This is my first repository. My Name is Vanessa and i'm learning how to use github to persue the career of web development. I'm persuing this career because in school you have so many subjects, and of all the subjects and projects that I took, web developing was my favorite. I just love how you can make interfaces as you imagine and have so many resources to play with. I also find it very interesting how much you can achieve with theese resources.
